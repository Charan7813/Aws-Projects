Introduction:
------------
This project focuses on implementing a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline using AWS ECS and AWS CodePipeline. The objective is to automate the build, test, and deployment process for a Dockerized application. We will leverage AWS services such as AWS CodeCommit for source control, AWS CodeBuild for building and testing the code, AWS CodeDeploy for automating the deployment, and AWS CodePipeline to orchestrate the entire workflow.

Steps:
------
1. Creating and Pushing the Docker Image to ECR
    - Build the Docker Image:
        - Create a Dockerfile for your application.
        - Build the Docker image locally using the command:
          ```
          docker build -t your-image-name .
          ```
    - Tag the Docker Image:
        - Tag your image with the ECR repository URI:
          ```
          docker tag your-image-name:latest aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/your-repo-name:latest
          ```
    - Authenticate Docker to ECR:
        - Use the AWS CLI to authenticate Docker with your ECR repository:
          ```
          aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
          ```
    - Push the Docker Image to ECR:
        - Push your Docker image to the ECR repository:
          ```
          docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/your-repo-name:latest
          ```

2. Creating an ECS Cluster
    - Open the ECS Console:
        - Navigate to the Amazon ECS console.
    - Create a Cluster:
        - Choose "Create Cluster" and select the appropriate cluster template (e.g., EC2 Linux + Networking).
        - Configure cluster settings and create the cluster.

3. Creating a Task Definition
    - Define the Task:
        - In the ECS console, go to the Task Definitions section and create a new task definition.
        - Choose the launch type (e.g., EC2 or Fargate) and configure the container details, including the image URI from ECR, memory, and CPU allocations.
    - Save the Task Definition:
        - Review and create the task definition.

4. Creating a Service
    - Create a Service:
        - In the ECS console, navigate to the "Services" tab and create a new service.
        - Select the cluster and task definition you created earlier.
        - Configure the service settings, including the number of desired tasks and load balancer settings if applicable.
    - Launch the Service:
        - Review and create the service.

5. Creating a CodeCommit Repository
    - Create Repository:
        - Navigate to the CodeCommit console.
        - Create a new repository and note the repository URL.
    - Clone Repository:
        - Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
          ```
          git clone repository-url
          ```

6. Creating a CodeBuild Project
    - Set Up CodeBuild:
        - In the CodeBuild console, create a new build project.
        - Configure the source provider to use your CodeCommit repository.
        - Set up the build environment and specify the build commands in a buildspec.yml file.
    - Create the Build Project:
        - Review and create the build project.

7. Creating a CodePipeline
    - Create Pipeline:
        - Navigate to the CodePipeline console.
        - Create a new pipeline and configure the source stage to use your CodeCommit repository.
    - Add Build Stage:
        - Add a build stage to the pipeline using the CodeBuild project you created.
    - Deploy Stage:
        - Add a deploy stage to the pipeline to deploy the application to your ECS service.
    - Review and Create Pipeline:
        - Review the pipeline settings and create the pipeline.
